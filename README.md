# URL Loadifier

A simple web tool that helps you open multiple URLs in new tabs with controlled timing. 

For example, if you've got a ton of tabs open on your old phone and you want to open them on your new phone, you can select all tabs on your old phone, share them to a text file, transfer the text file to your new phone, and then use this tool to open them all on your new phone. This will also allow you to bulk-open them into incognito tabs if that is preferred.
